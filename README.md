Introduction to Python, Numpy and Pandas DataFrame
Python is a high-level programming language that is widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing. It offers a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that make it easy to import, manipulate, and visualize data.

One of the most common tasks in data analysis is importing and summarizing data. Python offers several libraries such as Pandas and NumPy that make it easy to read and summarize data from various sources, including CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, and SQL databases.

Once you have imported your data, you may need to manipulate it to extract useful information or to clean it up. Python offers powerful tools for data manipulation, such as the Pandas library, which allows you to perform operations like filtering rows, updating columns, and grouping data.
Filtering rows is an essential task in data analysis because it enables you to focus on specific subsets of your data that meet certain criteria. You can use Python to filter rows based on conditions such as value, string matching, or logical expressions.

Finally, visualizing your data is an essential step in exploring and communicating your findings. Python offers a variety of libraries for data visualization, such as Matplotlib. These libraries provide an extensive set of tools for creating various types of charts and graphs that can help you to better understand your data and communicate your findings effectively.
